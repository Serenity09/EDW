Wow...
It's like a Special Ed class took a field trip to a Catholic Church

I see that you, too, hold a secret passion for the elegant art of figure skating
Remember to hold your head high, and always face towards your future
There's no stopping, just relentless progress towards that future
Keep track of yourself using the arrow keys or mouse, or type '-track' or '-t'

Another one of these shimmering portals...
Stepping over them seems to give you a checkpoint, and bring back the souls of your friends
But are they the same friends, or are these just copies?

Ahhh, I'd know that brick terrain anywhere
Brings me right back to my time in 'Nam
Touching them will change your world

Pull yourself together soldier!
You're a circle now!
Show some dignity, and use your arrow keys to move

Press Up to jump soldier!

Now, hold that wall close,
Like it was your fiance who promised that you'd never be alone but died far too young in a horrible accident that was no ones fault but has still left you a soul-less husk
And then press the Up key to do a wall-jump!

Hah, classic Red

Jesus christ, no, not like that
Press up to jump UP!
You are the reason I needed to add tutorials
