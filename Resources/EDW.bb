Easy now, what will show?

[LEFT]Welcome to Dream World! It's time to escape! In Dream World, all terrain tiles have unique, game-changing effects. Navigate these effects, and the suspicious characters you come across, to win the game! You'll need to run, dodge, slide and 2Dify your way to victory over up to 4 worlds and 10 levels. Good luck!

[Tab=Worlds]

Learn how the basics of the game in a easy-does-it tutorial level. While on the tutorial level you'll have unlimited continues, your deaths won't be counted, and you'll even instantly come back to life! What a deal!

Past the intro you'll find the Doors to different worlds. Each world has a different theme, mostly meaning the types of terrain and obstacles. The game is shipping with three worlds initially. A full game for new players will probably only see part of one world.

[otablei][tr][td][IMG]https://i.imgur.com/4mryzQm.png[/IMG][/td][td]The land world is about optimal movement, but also being able to pause for a second when necessary. It's probably the most beginner friendly world, focusing on fun elements while keeping the gameplay familiar[/td][/tr]
[tr][td][IMG]https://i.imgur.com/x6aLro7.png[/IMG][/td][td]The Ice world focuses on movement mechanics. It's meant to highlight your understanding and dexterity of movement. This world is pretty hard to start, and then picks up drastically from Level 3 onward[/td][/tr]
[tr][td][IMG]https://i.imgur.com/nfFNnyP.png[/IMG][/td][td]The 2.5D world focuses on changing perspective. It's meant to highlight how the same experience can play out so many different ways. This world isn't easy, but fun is definitely prioritized over difficulty[/td][/tr][/otablei]

As you advance through a world, you'll gain and lose continues, and (hopefully) gain in score. Run out of continues, though, and you'll be booted back to the Doors, where you can start another world. Want to retry a world? Go again and you'll be sent back to the last level you started. Your team cannot replay a world that they have already fully finished.

[Tab=FAQ]Q: there's so many terrain tiles! I can't enjoy all of them because I don't even know what's happening some of the time
A: yeah, that's a very real problem, and at this point I can't really see it fresh. The basic premise was that the tiles should all effect gameplay to some degree, and their combinations alone should be enough to be interesting even to veteran players. I think one of the biggest issues is that I present too many tiles that have significant gameplay impacts in quick succession, especially in the tutorial. I'd love to get feedback from you all on that topic

Q: the 2d terrain tiles looks don't match their physics geometry
A: that's another problem and I'm not going to solve it fully on my own. I tried to pick the most diamond looking tiles, and those are somewhat okay, but the square grass tile is especially confusing

Q: can you explain a mechanic more properly in game? trying to figure it out really detracted from my experience
A: yes! Please let me know which ones need it. That said, I try to explain less than more, while keeping the penalty for failure small initially. I really like the idea of the player discovering the different terrain effects and then exploring how it effects their gameplay / how they can use them situationally

Q: its hard to see the ice sometimes because of the trees!
A: true again! But you have to admit the trees add a lot more of a vibe to those levels than leaving them empty, and i can assure you that trees cannot kill people in my game. You should always be utterly confident of the fact that any time you die, it was me personally who killed you, and i don't do that about trees. The only exception to this rule are mortars teams, who are, by nature, single-mindedly murderous.
But this is splitting hairs, and there is something to your original point: you can still find trees not fun to deal with. Let me know the when/where/why that's the case and i'll remember your feelings (may not do anything about em, but they'll be there). Also, try those levels again with the wc3 occlusion setting enabled, and let me know how that is for you

Q: can I leave feedback directly?
A: yes! Thank you for taking the time to share. PM me directly here, or reply to the thread here
